# 2D Bounce
At first it was a screen saver project with 'fake', that is to say a very simplistic
behavior of the collisions between particles and bounds. 
The both particles were spawned with their raduis and the initial directions directly in code.
Subsequently I decided to implement the possibility to initialize the particles with
gesture of two fingers in order to vary the size of the particles. 
The switch for initialization is doubletap, then two fingers stretch for the size, then doubletap again. 
Once the particle is initialized it could be dragged and with one finger. 
It is necessary to do the same for the second particle.
Finally the direction of movement is given with launching gesture with one finger.
